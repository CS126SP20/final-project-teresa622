# Development

---
- **4/18/20** Figured out how to make tetrominoes fall and stack on top of each other.
    * Need to test all the currently functioning code
    * Next development: Translating and rotating tetrominoes with key controls
- **4/17/20** Began implementing Tetris
    * Figured out how to get randomly generated tetromino piece
    * Note: C++ uses time as a seed to generate random numbers
    * Next task: Make pieces fall down the screen
