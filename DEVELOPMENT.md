# Development

---
- **4/20/20**(hehe) Implemented line clearing functionality
    - [ ] Figure out how to not have more than 3 of the same tetromino in a row. Or should it be completely random..?
    - [ ] Add color to the tetrominoes. Maybe this functionality will be implemented in the farther future.
    * Continue to keep testing more
    * Figure out how to end the game if the player reaches the top of the screen
    * Implement more scoring functionalities with the database
- **4/19/20** Implemented rotation functionality
    * Consider modifying the rotation of L tetromino
    * Test more of tetromino
    * Next development: Implement user modified game settings(tile size, screen size, etc.) via command line
- **4/18/20** Figured out how to make tetrominoes fall and stack on top of each other.
    * Need to test all the currently functioning code
    * Next development: Translating and rotating tetrominoes with key controls
- **4/17/20** Began implementing Tetris
    * Figured out how to get randomly generated tetromino piece
    * Note: C++ uses time as a seed to generate random numbers
    * Next task: Make pieces fall down the screen
